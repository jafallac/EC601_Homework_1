In this project, we have read and analyze the codes in Python file of httpstat library, and tried to change the codes to improve its performance. In our group, everyone is responsible for analyzing and changing specific code. In the end, all of us discussed our own ideas and adjusted the codes again, then merged our branch into the master branch.
