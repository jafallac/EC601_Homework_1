# EC601_Homework_1
Team 12's First Homework Assignment.

We editted the httpstat library from our own branches and merged the changes into this branch.

In this project, we have read and analyze the codes in Python file of httpstat library, and tried to change the codes to improve its performance. In our group, everyone is responsible for analyzing and changing specific code. In the end, all of us discussed our own ideas and adjusted the codes again, then merged our branch into the master branch.

•	Yuanhao Jin’s work: Analyzing the nearly first third of codes, then add some comments, change the color variables and change the visual template of displayed results. 

James Fallacara's work: I looked through the second third of the coding. I changed some number values, added some lines of code, and added at least one comment.
